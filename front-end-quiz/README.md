# Getting Started with INT-QUIZ

## Figma Template

I created a Figma template design before start project and I coded website based on this Figma template.\
You can see my Figma template [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hQYpO7BVyZzaz6ePsNKgMd/Unitz's-Advisors?node-id=0%3A1)


## Connect Front-end With Back-end

You can get data from Back-end instead of from Json file.\
Just start Back-end then start Front-end.\
*Note: If Back-end not work, Front-end will auto get data from JSON file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
