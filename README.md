Thank you very for the test. 

I have completed the test given by the company.

I posted my work on github in branch nguyen_thanh_vo_app_test.

I choose react-native as my deployment platform for this test.

This test I only run on android because I don't have a macbook to do on ios and test it, so it may fail on ios.

Here I would like to show you the steps to run the project.

1. You need to setup the environment to run the project. You can refer to this link: 'https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup' for setup.

2. You must get the code from branch nguyen_thanh_vo_app_test.

3. Next, open a terminal and type 'cd AppTest'.

4. Finally, you use yarn android to run the program and wait for it to show up on the virtual machine.

I am very happy to complete the company test. Hopefully the company will give me a review of the results soon. 

Best regards,

Nguyen Thanh Vo
